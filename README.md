# TASK DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based predictive model that can automatically classify messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). With the exponential growth of digital communication through emails and messaging platforms, the need for intelligent spam filters has become essential to protect users from unwanted, malicious, or fraudulent content. This task leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect spam messages with high accuracy using Python’s Scikit-learn library.

The project begins by sourcing a publicly available dataset consisting of thousands of labeled SMS messages. Each entry in the dataset includes the message content and a corresponding label indicating whether it is spam or ham. The first step in the implementation involves loading and exploring this dataset using the pandas library to understand the distribution and structure of the data.

Once the data is loaded, a preprocessing phase is carried out. Since machine learning models cannot interpret raw text, the messages are converted into numerical representations using a method known as "vectorization." This is done using Scikit-learn’s CountVectorizer, which transforms each text message into a vector of word counts, essentially creating a feature matrix that can be fed into a machine learning algorithm.

The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The chosen classification algorithm for this task is the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier — a simple yet effective model particularly well-suited for text classification problems due to its probabilistic nature and ability to handle high-dimensional input data.

After training the model on the training data, it is tested on unseen data (test set) to evaluate its performance. Key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix are generated to assess how well the model distinguishes between spam and ham messages. These metrics are printed in the output, and a confusion matrix heatmap is visualized using the seaborn library for better interpretability.

The model achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its ability to effectively filter out spam messages while minimizing false positives (ham messages incorrectly classified as spam). An optional test is also implemented where users can manually input custom messages to observe how the model classifies them in real-time.

This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a real-world text classification model — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and user interaction. The entire implementation is done using a Jupyter Notebook environment, which provides a structured and interactive platform for coding, testing, and visualizing results.

In conclusion, this spam detection system provides a foundation for building more advanced email or SMS filtering systems. It highlights how machine learning and natural language processing can be integrated to automate the detection of harmful or unwanted communication, thus enhancing digital safety and user experience. This task is not only an academic exercise but also directly applicable in real-world scenarios such as email clients, messaging apps, and cybersecurity tools.
